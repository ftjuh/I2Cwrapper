  @brief Arduino library for I2C-control of stepper motors connected to
  another Arduino which runs the associated @ref firmware.ino "I2Cwrapper firmware".  
  See the @ref AccelStepperI2C "AccelStepperI2C class reference" for
  differences to the methods of the original AccelStepper class and for new
  methods of class %AccelStepperI2C.

  @todo add emergency stop/break pin for target (just use reset pin for the moment)
  @todo ATM data is not protected against updates from ISRs while it is being
  used in the main program (see http://gammon.com.au/interrupts). Check if this
  could be a problem in our case.
  @todo ESP32: make use of dual cores?
  @todo use interrupts for endstops instead of main loop polling (not sure how
  much of a difference this would make in practice, though. The main loop isn't
  doing much else, what really takes time are the computations.)
  @todo <del>update keywords.txt</del>
  @todo <del>clean up example sketches</del>
  @todo <del>implement runToPosition() and runToNewPosition() in controller</del> - implemented
  @todo <del>test (and adapt) target firmware for ESP8266</del> - implemented.
  However, I2C target mode on ESP8266s is no fun. Run only with 160MHz CPU and
  start testing with 10kHz (that's right: ten kHz) I2C clock speed.
  @todo <del>checking each transmission with sentOK and resultOK is tedious. We could
  use some counter to accumulate errors and check them summarily, e.g. at
  the end of setup etc.</del> - AccelStepperI2C::sentErrors(),
  AccelStepperI2C::resultErrors() and AccelStepperI2C::transmissionErrors() added
  @todo <del>make time the target has to answer I2C requests (I2CrequestDelay)
  configurable, as it will depend on ÂµC and bus frequency etc.</del> -
  setI2Cdelay() implemented
  @todo <del>Versioning, I2C command to request version (important, as library
  and firmware always need to match)</del> - getVersion() and checkVersion() implemented
  @todo <del>Implement interrupt mechanism, so that the target can inform the controller
  about finished tasks or other events</del> - setInterruptPin() and enableInterrupts()
  implemented
  @todo <del>implement diagnostic functions, e.g. measurements how long messages take
  to be processed or current stepper pulse frequency</del> - done, performance graphs
  included in documentation
  @todo <del>add ESP32 compatibility for target</del> - done, but needs further testing
  @todo <del>Make the I2C address programmable and persistent in EEPROM.</del> - done
  @todo <del>Error handling and sanity checks are rudimentary. Currently the
  system is not stable against transmission errors, partly due to the limitations
  of Wire.requestFrom() and Wire.available(). A better protocol would be
  needed, which would mean more overhead. Need testing to see how important
  this is in practics.</del> - CRC8 implemented
  @todo <del>Implement end stops/reference stops.</del> - endstop polling
  implemented, interrupt would be better

  @brief An I2C wrapper class for the [AccelStepper library](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/classAccelStepper.html).
  @details
  This class mimicks the [original AccelStepper interface](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/classAccelStepper.html).
  It replicates most of its methods and transmits each method call via I2C to
  a target running the @ref firmware.ino "AccelStepperI2C firmware".
  Functions and parameters without documentation will work just as their original,
  but you need to take the general restrictions into account (e.g. don't take a return
  value for valid without error handling).
