#include "_statusLED_firmware.h"        // makes the LED_BUILTIN flash briefly on each received interrupt

// note: use *only one* of the following "_address..." modules at a time.
// If all are deactivated, the default I2CwrapperDefaultAddress (0x8) will be used

//#include "_addressFixed_firmware.h"     // use a (non default) fixed I2C address for the target
//#include "_addressFromPins_firmware.h"  // make the target read its I2C address from a given set of input pin states (jumper bridges etc.)
//#include "_addressFromFlash_firmware.h" // read I2C address from flash memory or EEPROM, also implements the command to change and store a new address
